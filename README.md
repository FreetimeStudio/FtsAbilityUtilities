# FreetimeStudio Ability Utility Plugin

A collection of useful things I've created or collected and started sharing between projects. My understanding of 
Unreal's Gameplay Ability System is heavily based on the amazing projects [GASDocumentation](https://github.com/tranek/GASDocumentation) and [GASShooter](https://github.com/tranek/GASShooter) 
and I recommend anyone to check it out! Since they are whole projects though they aren't easily integrated in other
projects so I am using this plugin instead.
